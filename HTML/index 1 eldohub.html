HTML is made up of elements.
an element has an opening tag and a closing tag
Example:

    opening tag                     <\html>
                                      closing tag 
     -within the opening and closing tag,
     we could have other elements(children)   or text
     content
     -HTML's structurebuild a family tree like structure
     -some elementsare self closing e.g img,input,
     meta elements

     and search engine optimization
     ---Semantic HTML--HTML elements that convey a
     meanin/message about it's content to search engines and accessibility tools.
